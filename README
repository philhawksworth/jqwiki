jQwiki (pronounced jay-quickie) is a self contained, simple wiki application.

jQwiki delivers content in HTML and adds functionality with Javascript and the jQuery Javascript library.

The data and application logic are all contained within a single file which you run in your browser.

This project is just getting started. For news and announcements go to http://jqwiki.com or follow http://twitter.com/philhawksworth
